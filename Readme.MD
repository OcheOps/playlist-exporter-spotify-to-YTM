## üîß Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OcheOps/playlist-exporter-spotify-to-YTM.git
cd playlist-exporter-spotify-to-YTM
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file
```env
SPOTIFY_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

You can get these credentials from:

- [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

Set the redirect URIs:

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the tool
```bash
go run main.go
```

Follow the prompts to:
- Login to Spotify and YouTube
- Choose a playlist or migrate liked songs

---

## üß† Features

- **Smart Matching:** Uses `track name + artist + topic` to find official YouTube uploads
- **Resume Support:** Tracks are saved in `migrated.txt` to avoid duplicates
- **Quota Safe:** Limits each run to 100 tracks (customizable in `main.go`)
- **Fallback Logic:** If no `- Topic` upload is found, uses the first search result

---

## üêû Known Issues

### Unofficial YouTube Music API Limitations
- Initially, we attempted to use `ytmusicapi`, the unofficial YouTube Music API, for better search accuracy.
- However, recent changes to YouTube Music have made this API unreliable and difficult to authenticate without browser header scraping.

**Solution:**
- We reverted to using the official YouTube Data API with smart query construction (e.g., adding "topic") for better results.


### YouTube Data API Quota Limit
- YouTube has a daily quota of 10,000 units.
- Each `Search.list` costs **100 units**, and each `PlaylistItems.insert` costs **50 units**.
- With large playlists or liked songs (e.g., 5,000+ tracks), the quota will likely be exceeded.

**Solution:**
- The tool limits to 100 songs per run (configurable).
- You can re-run the script daily ‚Äî already migrated songs are skipped using `migrated.txt`.

## üí° Tips

- Want to migrate more songs? Just run it again later ‚Äî it skips already added tracks.
- Adjust `maxToTransfer` if you want to process fewer tracks.
